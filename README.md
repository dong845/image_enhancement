# image_enhancement

## Current Status

- Use the code of CycleGAN as reference, considering the situation that can't find the way to  implement registration method to align image pairs (high quality and low quality)
- For the evaluation metrics, LNCC has some problems (can't implement well)
- Based on my observation, training results look not good. (In fact, GAN models are always hard to train). Need to optimize from some aspects, like model structure and hyper-parameters
